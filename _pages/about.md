I am a fourth year undergraduate student from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Ocean University of China. My research interests include optimization in machine learning and computational neuroscience.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xueying Zeng from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Ocean University of China.

You can find my CV here: [Chenru Wang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).


Research Experience
======

- **Research on Inversion and Editing Techniques in Generative Models**  
  *Apr. 2025 – Present, AGI Lab, Westlake University (Advisor: Chi Zhang)*  
  Developed a plug-and-play velocity correction framework to improve inversion stability and editing fidelity in flow-based generative models. Achieved state-of-the-art results on PIE-Bench; first-author paper is under review.

- **Research on Detection of Coronary Artery Stenosis**  
  *Jun. 2023 – Apr. 2024, Ocean University of China (Advisor: Xueying Zeng)*  
  Applied deep learning techniques to assist physicians in diagnosing coronary artery disease and reduce diagnostic errors. Proposed the Deformable Dilatable U-structure Module to enhance model generalization. Constructed the 302 dataset to evaluate performance in clinical scenarios.

- **Research on Image Denoising and Enhancement for Coronary Angiography**  
  *Nov. 2022 – Sept. 2023, Ocean University of China (Advisor: Xueying Zeng)*  
  Explored denoising and enhancement techniques, proposed a novel hybrid method. Developed a new super-resolution method by integrating deep learning and traditional techniques.
